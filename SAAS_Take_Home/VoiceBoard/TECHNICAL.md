# VoiceBoard Technical Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

VoiceBoard implements a clean, modular architecture designed for maintainability, performance, and compliance with iOS App Extension guidelines. The system uses established design patterns with clear separation of concerns across multiple specialized components.

## Component Architecture Design

### Primary Architecture Pattern

The application follows Model-View-Controller architecture enhanced with dedicated service layers for complex operations. This approach ensures clear responsibility separation while maintaining clean interfaces between components.

The KeyboardViewController serves as the primary coordinator, managing the overall keyboard lifecycle and coordinating between user interface events and backend services. This controller handles the bridge between UIKit requirements for keyboard extensions and modern SwiftUI interface implementation.

SwiftUI views handle all user interface presentation and interaction detection, while dedicated service classes manage complex operations like audio recording and network communication. This separation enables independent testing and maintenance of different system aspects.

### Core Component Responsibilities

#### KeyboardViewController Implementation

The KeyboardViewController class inherits from UIInputViewController as required by iOS keyboard extension architecture. This controller manages the complete keyboard lifecycle including initialization, audio session configuration, haptic feedback preparation, and coordination of recording and transcription workflows.

The controller implements proper memory management with weak reference patterns to prevent retain cycles in the constrained keyboard extension environment. It handles all communication between the SwiftUI interface and the underlying iOS systems for audio and network functionality.

Error handling coordination ensures that problems from any system component are properly communicated to users through the interface with appropriate visual feedback and recovery suggestions.

#### SwiftUI Interface Layer

The KeyboardView struct provides the primary user interface using modern SwiftUI declarative syntax. The view manages all user interaction states including idle, recording, processing, success, and error conditions with appropriate visual representations.

State management uses SwiftUI's reactive programming model with proper data binding between interface elements and underlying system state. Animation coordination provides smooth transitions between different operational states.

The view handles gesture recognition for press-and-hold recording functionality with precise timing and appropriate tolerance for user interaction variations. Visual feedback systems provide immediate response to user actions with color changes, animations, and status indicators.

#### Audio Recording Service

The AudioRecorderManager class encapsulates all audio recording functionality using AVAudioRecorder with proper permission handling and file management. The service manages audio session configuration, recording quality settings, and automatic cleanup of temporary files.

Recording operations include comprehensive error handling for permission denial, hardware unavailability, and storage issues. The service implements delegate patterns for asynchronous operation reporting and proper integration with the main keyboard controller.

File management includes automatic cleanup of temporary audio files after transcription completion to prevent storage accumulation in the keyboard extension sandbox environment.

#### Network Communication Service

The NetworkService class handles all communication with Groq's Whisper API including request formation, multipart data encoding, authentication management, and response parsing. The service implements robust error handling for network connectivity issues, API authentication problems, and service availability challenges.

Request handling uses URLSession with proper timeout configuration and retry logic for temporary failures. Multipart form-data encoding ensures efficient audio file transmission with appropriate headers and boundary management.

Response parsing includes comprehensive validation of API responses with proper error extraction and user-friendly message generation for different failure scenarios.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Recording Workflow Process

User interface gesture detection triggers recording initiation through the KeyboardViewController coordinator. The audio recording service begins capture with proper session configuration and permission validation.

During recording, the interface provides real-time feedback through waveform visualization and haptic responses. The recording service monitors audio levels and duration while maintaining temporary file management.

Recording completion triggers automatic file processing and network transmission to the transcription service. The interface transitions to processing state with appropriate visual indicators while maintaining responsive user experience.

### Transcription and Text Insertion Flow

Completed audio files are transmitted to the Groq Whisper API through the network service with proper authentication and error handling. The service monitors request progress and handles various response scenarios including successful transcription, API errors, and network failures.

Successful transcription results are parsed and validated before text insertion through the iOS text document proxy. The interface confirms successful text insertion with appropriate visual feedback and state transitions.

Error scenarios are handled gracefully with clear user feedback and suggested recovery actions. The system returns to ready state after completion or error resolution.

### Error Handling and Recovery

Comprehensive error handling covers all potential failure points including network connectivity issues, API authentication failures, audio recording problems, permission denial scenarios, and system resource limitations.

Each error type includes specific recovery mechanisms ranging from automatic retry for temporary issues to clear user guidance for configuration problems. Error messages use user-friendly language with actionable suggestions rather than technical error codes.

## Memory Management Strategy

### Extension Memory Optimization

The implementation specifically addresses iOS keyboard extension memory constraints through careful resource management and automatic cleanup procedures. Recording duration limits prevent excessive memory usage while temporary file cleanup ensures sandbox storage remains manageable.

Object lifecycle management uses weak reference patterns throughout the architecture to prevent retain cycles that could cause memory leaks in the constrained extension environment. All major objects implement proper deinitialization with resource cleanup.

Data structures are optimized for memory efficiency while maintaining functionality requirements. Audio processing uses efficient formats and compression settings that balance quality with resource consumption.

### Performance Optimization Techniques

Network requests use efficient data encoding and transmission methods with appropriate timeout settings to prevent resource blocking. Audio processing implements streaming patterns where possible to minimize peak memory usage.

User interface animations and state transitions are optimized for smooth performance while minimizing CPU and memory overhead. The waveform visualization uses efficient rendering techniques that provide visual appeal without excessive resource consumption.

## Security and Privacy Implementation

### Data Protection Measures

Voice recordings are stored temporarily in the application sandbox with automatic deletion after transcription completion. No persistent storage of voice data occurs within the application, ensuring user privacy protection.

Audio transmission to transcription services uses encrypted HTTPS communication with proper authentication headers. The system does not store or cache transcription requests or responses beyond immediate processing requirements.

API key storage follows iOS security best practices with multiple configuration options including secure Info.plist embedding, environment variable configuration, and extensible architecture for Keychain integration in production deployments.

### Permission and Access Management

The application properly requests and validates microphone permissions through the main application target as required by iOS security model. Keyboard extensions inherit permissions from their containing applications while maintaining appropriate access restrictions.

Network access permissions are handled through the "Allow Full Access" keyboard setting which users must explicitly enable to permit API communication from keyboard extensions.

## Integration and Compatibility

### iOS System Integration

The keyboard integrates seamlessly with iOS system services including text input handling, theme adaptation, accessibility features, and multi-application compatibility. The implementation follows Apple's accessibility guidelines for keyboard extensions.

System integration includes proper handling of device rotation, multitasking scenarios, and background/foreground transitions that may occur during keyboard usage across different applications.

### Cross-Application Functionality

The keyboard provides consistent functionality across all iOS applications that support custom keyboards including messaging applications, note-taking apps, social media platforms, and productivity applications.

Text insertion works reliably across different text input contexts including single-line fields, multi-line text areas, and applications with custom text handling implementations.

## Development and Maintenance

### Code Maintainability

The modular architecture supports easy maintenance and feature enhancement through clear component interfaces and comprehensive documentation. Each major component can be modified or extended independently without affecting other system areas.

Configuration management centralizes all application settings and API parameters in a single location for easy maintenance and deployment management across different environments.

### Testing and Validation

The architecture supports comprehensive testing through modular design and clear component interfaces. Each service class can be tested independently with appropriate mock objects and test scenarios.

Integration testing can validate complete workflows from user interaction through text insertion with proper error scenario coverage and performance validation under different usage conditions.

## Technical Specifications Summary
